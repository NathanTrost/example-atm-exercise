## Questions

### What issues, if any, did you find with the existing code?

- There were several major vulnerabilities in the install that I would have liked to have fixed with updates, but was unsure as
  to how much time that could take in regard to breaking changes

### What issues, if any, did you find with the request to add functionality?

- The error messaging was fairly lacking

### Would you modify the structure of this project if you were to start it over? If so, how?

- I would wrap the entire project with vite (or something comparable) to be able to get quick feedback on local development

### Were there any pieces of this project that you were not able to complete that you'd like to mention?

- Would have liked to add error specific language on the inputs

### If you were to continue building this out, what would you like to add next?

- I'd add testing to both the front and back end
- I'd update all packages to the most modern version, especially to eliminate the vulnerabilities discovered on install
- I'd wrap the entire project in something like vite that would allow for me to run both packages locally and view up to date changes
- I only added basic error styling to the inputs, I would add some further styling to give it a bit of a pop
- I'd add error specific language on the inputs

Just for context, I've not worked heavily, or even at all, with most of the backend pieces for this project. This is not to say
I can't, just to point out that much of it is a fairly unfamiliar area as I've been very focused on Front End concerns in the last 10 years or so.

- I've worked minimally with express on a handful of features, so was fairly familiar with it
- I've never directly worked with postgreSQL, though have in the past worked with other SQL and MySQL
- I've never worked with Joi, although have worked extensively with Zod which is similar
- I've worked on several projects which use docker and have had to interact with it, but for the most part those scripts have been abstracted in the projects I've worked with.

Since I do have a heavy history with FE, and this criteria for this task primarily concerns the api project I chose to spend much of my time on the back end piece.
